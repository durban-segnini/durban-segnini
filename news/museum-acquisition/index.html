<p>We are delighted to announce that several works from our gallery have been acquired by major international museums. The Museum of Modern Art in New York has acquired Felipe Mujica's &quot;Soltaré cien conejos y usted verá cómo le hace para juntarlos todos (Cortina 9)&quot; for their permanent collection.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Tate Modern in London has acquired Maria Rodriguez's &quot;Memory Fragments&quot; series, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris has added Carlos Mendoza's &quot;Neural Landscape 7&quot; to their collection. These acquisitions reflect the growing international recognition of Latin American contemporary art and the important role our gallery plays in supporting and promoting these artists.</p>
<p>We congratulate all the artists on these significant achievements and look forward to seeing their works in these prestigious institutions.</p>
