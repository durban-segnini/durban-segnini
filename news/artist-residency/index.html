<p>Durban Segnini Gallery is launching a new artist residency program that will provide emerging Latin American artists with studio space, materials, and curatorial support for three-month periods. The program aims to foster artistic development and cultural exchange while supporting the next generation of contemporary artists.</p>
<p>The first residents will be Ana Silva, whose work explores urban memory and displacement, and Carlos Mendoza, whose digital art investigates the intersection of neuroscience and aesthetics. Both artists will be working on new projects that will be presented in a group exhibition at the end of their residency period.</p>
<p>Applications for the 2026 residency program are now open. Interested artists should submit a portfolio and project proposal through our website.</p>
