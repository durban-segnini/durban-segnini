We are delighted to announce that several works from our gallery have been acquired by major international museums. The Museum of Modern Art in New York has acquired Felipe Mujica's "Soltaré cien conejos y usted verá cómo le hace para juntarlos todos (Cortina 9)" for their permanent collection.

Additionally, the Tate Modern in London has acquired Maria Rodriguez's "Memory Fragments" series, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris has added Carlos Mendoza's "Neural Landscape 7" to their collection. These acquisitions reflect the growing international recognition of Latin American contemporary art and the important role our gallery plays in supporting and promoting these artists.

We congratulate all the artists on these significant achievements and look forward to seeing their works in these prestigious institutions.
