Durban Segnini Gallery had an outstanding presence at this year's Art Basel Miami Beach, with strong sales and critical acclaim for our presentation of contemporary Latin American art. Our booth featured works by all eight gallery artists, including new pieces by Ana Silva and Carlos Mendoza.

The fair marked the debut of several new works, including Silva's "Concrete Dreams 12" and Mendoza's "Neural Landscape 7," both of which received significant attention from collectors and curators. We are pleased to report that over 80% of the works presented were sold, with several pieces going to major private collections and museums.

We look forward to continuing this momentum at upcoming fairs, including Frieze London in October and Art Basel in Basel next June.
