short_bio: Alessandro Balteo-Yazbeck is a Venezuelan artist whose
  multidisciplinary practice intertwines art, research, curatorial methods, and
  historical analysis into a critical reflection on modernity and its enduring
  political and cultural consequences. Through photography, film, installation,
  and found materials, his work explores the complex intersections between
  aesthetics, power, and ideology. Balteo-Yazbeck investigates the narratives
  that shape global politics, economy, and culture, exposing how systems of
  representation have contributed to the dehumanizing effects of modern history

He earned a Bachelor’s degree from the Armando Reverón University Institute of Higher Studies in Caracas, Venezuela, and later completed a Master’s in Translation at Montclair University, United States. His early work was widely exhibited in Venezuelan institutions between 1994 and 2000, a period marked by a deep engagement with the social and political landscape of his native country. After relocating to the United States, he presented significant solo exhibitions including Little Piece of Heaven (1998–2008) at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, Harvard University (2008), and Diplomatic Entanglements at the Rochester Art Center, Minnesota (2015). These projects exemplify his capacity to interlace historical documentation with artistic construction, transforming archives into instruments of critique.
