Carlos Mendoza is a digital artist and researcher whose work bridges the gap between neuroscience and contemporary art. His "Neural Landscapes" series uses algorithmic processes to generate abstract compositions that mirror the complex patterns of neural networks in the human brain.

Mendoza's practice involves extensive collaboration with neuroscientists and computer scientists, resulting in works that are both aesthetically compelling and scientifically informed. His installations often incorporate real-time data from brain imaging technologies, creating dynamic visualizations that respond to neural activity.

Based in Bogotá, Colombia, Mendoza has been a pioneer in the field of neuroaesthetics, exploring how art can help us understand the mechanisms of human perception and consciousness.
