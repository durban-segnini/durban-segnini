short_bio: Fanny Sanín is a Colombian painter and engraver whose career has been
  fundamental to the development of geometric abstraction in Latin America. She
  studied Fine Arts at the Universidad de Los Andes in Bogotá and in 1962
  participated in the XIV Salón de Artistas Nacionales, where she presented her
  first painting, *Óleo N.º 1*. That same year she moved to the United States to
  pursue studies in printmaking and art history at the University of Illinois.
  After returning briefly to Colombia, she participated in the XVI Salón de
  Artistas Nacionales (1964) before moving to Monterrey, Mexico. By 1966, she
  had settled in London to further her studies in engraving at the Chelsea
  School of Art and the Central School of Art. In 1968 she returned to
  Monterrey, and in 1971 she established permanent residence in New York, where
  she continues to live and work.

 Sanín’s early production was characterized by an abstract and lyrical sensibility, often imbued with expressionist undertones. Over time, she transitioned toward a refined visual language rooted in geometric abstraction, developing a disciplined and highly personal poetics of color. Her paintings are distinguished by their rigorous organization of chromatic spaces, as well as by a precise articulation of balance between planes and lines. Through these formal strategies, Sanín has cultivated a body of work that is both mathematically rigorous and spiritually resonant, positioning her as one of the most significant abstract artists of her generation.

Throughout her career, Sanín has presented numerous solo exhibitions across the Americas and Europe. Highlights include early shows at the Modern Art Gallery in Monterrey (1964), Museo de Arte Moderno in Bogotá (1965), and Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Caracas Sofía Imber (1967), as well as later exhibitions at the Panamerican Union Gallery in Washington, DC (1969), Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City (1979), Schiller-Wapner Gallery in New York (1986), Greater Lafayette Museum of Art in Indiana (1990), National Arts Club in New York (2003), and Frederico Seve Gallery in New York (2013). Her works are held in major collections and institutions worldwide, including the Bibliothèque Nationale (Paris), Museum of Art of the Americas (Washington, DC), Minnesota Museum of Art (St. Paul), Museo de Arte Moderno (Bogotá), Museo de Arte Moderno (Mexico City), and the Chemical Bank Collection (New York). Her work also featured in the 2022 *Aichi Triennale* in Japan and a solo survey *Fanny Sanín: Geometric Equations* at the Americas Society in New York in 2025, which included large canvases, drawings and pencil studies tracing her evolution as a color-structural painter. Recently after her exhibition at Americas Society the Museum of Modern Art in New York acquired two of her early works. She lives and works in New York.
