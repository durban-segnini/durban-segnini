short_bio: Marcolina Dipierro is an Argentine abstract artist whose work
  examines formal aspects of modern architecture and design in contrast with a
  diverse range of materials ranging from organic to industrial elements. Her
  aesthetic sculptures and installations explore the meaning behind the
  materials in contrast to their function, design, and space; ultimately
  creating an infinite network of relationships across these segments.

Dipierro’s practice focuses on transition spaces—interstitial zones where materials converge, generating new meanings. Through a fusion of functionalism, artistic expression, and decoration, she constructs compositions that operate within an intrinsic infrastructure, where design plays a fundamental role beyond utility. Through the juxtaposition of elements such as rocks, tree trunks, amorphous organic masses, and industrialized materials like glass and metal, Dipierro examines the tension, pressure, and suspension inherent in their interactions. These material behaviors, along with their transformations, form the foundation of her sculptural practice, challenging conventional perceptions of space, structure, and artistic intent.

She earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the National School of Fine Arts "Prilidiano Pueyrredón" and debuted her first solo exhibition, *Siluetaje*, in 2001 at Sonoridad Amarilla. Since then, she has exhibited extensively in national and international fairs and galleries. Notable solo exhibitions include *En Planograf* (Galería Zavaleta Lab, 2010), *En ángulo* (Recoleta Cultural Center, 2011), *Circle* (Alejandra Von Hartz Gallery, Miami, 2014), and *Interrupted Line* (Sayago & Pardon Collection, Harris Center for the Arts, 2014). Her work has been featured in group exhibitions at Fundación PROA, MAMBA, MACBA, and Mana Contemporary, among others.

Dipierro has received numerous accolades, including the Cultural Equality Contest Prize (2013), the National Fund for the Arts Creation Grant (2015), and the Lucio Fontana Scholarship (2016). Her works are held in prominent public and private collections worldwide. She lives and works in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
