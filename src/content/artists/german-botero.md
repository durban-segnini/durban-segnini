short_bio: Germán Botero studied at the School of Architecture of the National
  University of Colombia. He was a founding member of the Industrial Design
  program at the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana and the art program at the
  Universidad Nacional de Colombia, both in Medellín. In 1976 he was awarded the
  National Sculpture Award at the XXVI Salón Nacional de Artistas. This fostered
  his interest in creating artwork that explored geometric abstraction through
  sculpture.

Using materials such as metal, wood, and clay, his structural work is inspired by the machinery and objects of different technologies and cultures. He lives and works in Bogota, Colombia since 1983.

Germán Botero’s body of work is founded upon the traditions of minimalist and land art, where architectural and sculptural forms generate a direct dialog with the landscape. He creates modular structures, that explore the dimensions of space and invite us to think about science in relation to our socio-cultural environment. Working in both small and large scale, his works present an investigation of industrial archeology and allude to ritual sites and ceremonial geographies of pre-Columbian civilizations. 

As a specialist in public art, he has installed monumental works in Seoul, Korea, Shanghai, China; in the Mayan region of Chetumal, Mexico; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Montreal, Canada, Resistencia, Argentina and Cuba. 

In 2010, during the Olympic games in Beijing, he was presented the Award of Excellence for his work entitled *Loto Floreciendo a los Cielos.* The exhibition’s theme was China and the World, and the slogan, “The Arts Complement the Spirit of the Olympic Games Celebrated in Beijing.”
