Ana Silva is a contemporary artist whose work investigates the relationship between personal memory and collective urban experience. Born in Caracas, Venezuela, Silva's practice encompasses sculpture, installation, and mixed media works that often incorporate found materials from urban environments.

Her recent series "Concrete Dreams" examines the psychological impact of rapid urbanization in Latin American cities, using concrete fragments, metal scraps, and digital projections to create immersive environments that question notions of permanence and transience in modern life.

Silva has exhibited internationally and her work is held in several private collections across Latin America and Europe. She currently lives and works between Caracas and Miami.
