Although he first gained fame for his achievements as a painter, he is also renowned for his notebooks filled with drawings and observations on subjects such as anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. Leonardo is widely regarded as a genius who embodied the ideals of the Renaissance humanist tradition, and his body of work made a lasting impact on later generations of artists, rivaled only by that of his younger contemporary Michelangelo.
