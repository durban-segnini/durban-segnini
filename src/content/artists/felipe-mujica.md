Mujica studied visual arts at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. In 1997, he co-founded Galería Chilena, an artist-run space that operated until 2005, initially as a commercial gallery and later as a curatorial experiment. Alongside his own practice, he has organized numerous exhibitions and publications, often fostering collaborative artistic dialogues.

Since the mid-2000s, Mujica has exhibited extensively in museums, biennials, and galleries worldwide. His solo shows include exhibitions at Museo de Arte Moderno de Medellín; Museo Experimental El Eco, Mexico City; Casa Triângulo, São Paulo; and Proyectos Ultravioleta, Guatemala City. In 2021, his most extensive institutional exhibition to date, "The Swaying Motion on the Bank of the River Falls," was presented at the Pérez Art Museum Miami, featuring textile works created in collaboration with Miccosukee Tribe artisans in South Florida to create textile-based works inspired by traditional patchwork motifs. Other major exhibitions include "Cortinas" at Dimensions Variable, Miami (2021), and "What Were You Thinking About, in the Past or the Future?" at the Museum of Visual Arts (MAVI UC), Santiago (2020).

Mujica has participated in international biennials such as the 32nd Bienal de São Paulo (2016), the 12th Cuenca Biennial (2014), and the 3rd Guangzhou Triennial (2009). His work has been featured in significant group exhibitions, including Embodied Absence: Chilean Art of the 1970s Now at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, Harvard University (2016), and Ways of Working: The Incidental Object at Fondazione Merz, Turin (2013). His work is held in numerous international collections and has been exhibited at institutions across Latin America, Europe, Asia, and the United States. He lives and works in New York.
