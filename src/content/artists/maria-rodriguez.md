---
Maria Rodriguez is a multimedia artist whose work explores themes of cultural displacement, memory, and identity through the lens of textile traditions and photographic processes. Born in Mexico City, Rodriguez's practice examines how personal and collective memories are constructed, preserved, and transformed across generations.

Her "Memory Fragments" series combines traditional embroidery techniques with contemporary photographic processes, creating layered works that speak to the complexity of cultural transmission in diasporic communities. Rodriguez often incorporates family photographs, oral histories, and traditional textile patterns into her installations.

Rodriguez has participated in numerous group exhibitions and residencies across Latin America and the United States. She currently lives and works in Mexico City and New York.
