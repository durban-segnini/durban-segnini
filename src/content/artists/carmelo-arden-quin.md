short_bio: Painter, sculptor, and poet. From an early age, he began painting and
  participating in political demonstrations with friends. In 1935 he met Joaquin
  Torres Garcia at a conference at the headquarters of the Theosophical
  Society.  That year, after creating cubist style proposals, he made his first
  geometric non-orthogonal paintings, transgressing the traditional limits of
  the rectangle. By 1937 he settled in Buenos Aires where he surrounded himself
  with modern artists and studied philosophy and literature.  In 1941 he
  cofounded the bimonthly newspaper *El Universitario*, where he published his
  political and aesthetic ideas. He participated in the publishing group
  of *Arturo. Revista de Artes Abstractas* along with Gyula Kosice, Rhod
  Rothfuss, Edgar Bayley, Tomás Maldonado and Lidy Prati. In 1944 they edited
  the sole edition, in which Murillo Mendes, Vicente Huidobro and Torres García
  also collaborated. This publication marked the beginning of the non-figurative
  movement in Argentina.

In 1945 he cofounded the group Movimiento de Arte Concreto Invención. A year later, the group was split into two groups: the Arte Concreto Invencion Association and the Madi Group. Arden Quin and other artists launched the Madi movement. The movement’s main characteristics are irregular frames, movable and displacing architecture, pan interval music composition and invented poetic propositions. The Madi philosophy encompassed painting, design, sculpture, architecture and politics.  Arden Quin read his Madi manifesto in 1946 to a group of critics and journalists at the French Institute for Higher Learning in Buenos Aires.  His manifesto and the movement was rooted in his commitment to activism and politics, as well as from the artistic and ideological ideas of Torres-Garcia and the Futurism movement in Italy.  During this time, he made polygonal frame works, mobile structures, coplanars, object paintings and concave works, which he called *Formes Galbées*.   

Around 1948 he moved to Paris, where he frequented with mordern artists such as Jean Arp and Georges Braque. He held numerous exhibitions and participated in the Salon des Realites Nouvelles. During this period, he introduced collage and decoupage in his work. In Buenos Aires, he co-founded the Arte Nuevo group, along with artists of various non-figurative tendencies. The group’s first exhibition was held at the Van Riel Gallery in 1954. 

In Paris he directed the magazine *Ailleurs* and, during the 1960s, he participated in the Poesia Concreta movement. He returned to painting in 1971 and continued to work at his home in Savigny sur-Orge until his death in 2010.

His most important solo exhibitions include but are not limited to: Galerie Charley Chevalier (Paris, 1973) “Retrospective 1936-1985”; Galerie des Ponchettes (Nice, 1985); Arte y Tecnología Foundation (Madrid, 1997); Durban Segnini Gallery (Miami, 2006); “A Celebration of Geometric Art, MADÍ Homage to Carmelo Arden Quin”, Leepa Rattner Museum of Art (Tarpon Springs, Florida, 2006).
