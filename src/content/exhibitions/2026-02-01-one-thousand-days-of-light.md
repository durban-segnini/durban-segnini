One Thousand Days of Light is a major upcoming exhibition that brings together works from across our gallery's program to explore themes of illumination, both literal and metaphorical. The exhibition will feature works by Mario Abreu, Ana Silva, Carlos Mendoza, and Maria Rodriguez.

The title references both the physical properties of light in art and the metaphorical light of knowledge, understanding, and cultural exchange. The exhibition will include works in various media, from Abreu's sculptural installations to Mendoza's digital neural landscapes, creating a comprehensive survey of contemporary Latin American art practice.

This exhibition will be accompanied by a comprehensive catalog and a series of public programs including artist talks, panel discussions, and educational workshops.
