La Prueba (The Test) was a focused exhibition featuring Felipe Mujica's curtain works, exploring themes of performance, ritual, and the testing of boundaries. The exhibition created an intimate environment where visitors could experience the transformative power of Mujica's geometric textiles.

The title suggests both examination and proof, reflecting Mujica's interest in how art can test our assumptions about space, time, and social interaction. The curtain works function as both barriers and invitations, creating a dynamic relationship between viewer and artwork.
