Durban Segnini Gallery is pleased to present Painting: The Unconventional Support, an exhibition of painting and sculpture by César Paternosto. Focusing on the continuity of Paternosto’s ideas throughout the evolution of his art, the exhibition includes works that range from his early “edge” or “lateral” paintings to his most recent canvases.

César Paternosto (b. 1931, La Plata, Argentina) is a painter, sculptor, and theorist whose work has made important contributions to postwar abstraction. He lived in New York between 1967 and 2004, later moving to Segovia, Spain. He has organized exhibitions that include Abstraction: The Amerindian Paradigm in 2001 at the Société des Expositions du Palais des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles, which focused on the emergence of an abstraction born of a

cross-fertilization with the indigenous arts of the Americas, and Towards Painting as Object in 2017 at the Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid.
