Future Memories is an upcoming exhibition that explores how artists envision and construct memory in the digital age. Featuring works by Mario Abreu, the show examines the intersection of personal narrative, collective history, and technological mediation.

The exhibition will include Abreu's sculptural investigations of form and connection, creating a dialogue about how we remember, forget, and imagine the future.
