### Mariana Bunimov

Caracas, Venezuela, 1972

Lives and works in Paris

Mariana Bunimov’s paintings “set her interlocutor in the middle of a crossroads where, with no hierarchy or apparent connection, thousands of images hailing as much from her imagination as from her daily round cross paths. Defying any kind of criterion or absolute, the eclectic nature of her world is also the reflection of the spirit of our time, the zeitgeist: a fragmented and hybrid world where the permanent flow of many different and divergent images and data converges in an ongoing immediacy which goes beyond any given geography or timeframe.”

Mariana Bunimov (Venezuela, 1972; lives and works in Paris) has had solo exhibitions at Galerie Michel Rein (Brussels, 2024; Paris, 2023, 2021); Henrique Faria Fine Art (New York, 2022, 2017); Pamela Weissenberg (Mexico City, 2024); ArtBo (Bogotá, 2016; curated by Jens Hoffmann); Periférico Caracas (2008); the Museo Alejandro Otero (Caracas, 2000) and elsewhere. Group exhibitions include the X Bienal de La Habana (Punto de Encuentro); the 7th Gwangju Biennale (curated by Okwui Enwezor); the Americas Society (New York); ICA (Antwerp); Apex Art (New York); New York Film Archives; the 21st Biennial of São Paulo, among others.

### Luis Molina-Pantin

Geneva, 1969

As a self-described “urban archaeologist,” Molina-Pantin investigates themes of authority, class, and display. His work documents Venezuela’s decades-long collapse and modern culture, offering insightful social and political commentary.

Luis Molina-Pantin (Venezuelan, born in Geneva, 1969) currently lives in Mexico City.

### Alexander Apóstol

Barquisimeto, Venezuela, 1969

Lives and works in Madrid, Spain

Alexander Apóstol is a multimedia conceptual artist whose work examines the intersections of architecture, art, and politics in Venezuela, particularly in relation to the fractures of the country’s modernist project. Working primarily with photography and video (although also frequently collaborating with collectives and professionals from other disciplines), Apóstol investigates how artistic practices have been co-opted by state-led agendas to promote national identities. Throughout his practice, Apóstol embodies and sexualizes political discourse by connecting it to social, generational, and gender identities, as well as his own personal history.

Alexander Apóstol has had solo shows at the Centro de Arte Dos de Mayo (CA2M) (Móstoles, Madrid); the Fundación PROA (Buenos Aires); the Museo de Arte Moderno Bogotá (Bogotá); the Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo (MUAC) (Mexico City); the Musée d’art Contemporain de Bordeaux (CAPC) (Bordeaux); the Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires (MALBA) (Buenos Aires). He has participated in group exhibitions at the Tate Modern (London); Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía (Madrid); the Guggenheim Museum (New York); Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art (Rotterdam); the neue Gesellschaft für bildende Kunst (NGBK) (Berlin); Museo Jumex (Mexico City); Pérez Art Museum Miami (Miami); the Bronx Museum of the Arts (New York) and elsewhere. Apóstol has participated in international events such as the Cuenca Biennial (2023); the Shanghai Biennial (2018); the Gwangju Biennale (2018); EVA International (2018); Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA (2017); Manifesta 9 (2013); the 54th Venice Biennale (2011); VIII Istanbul Biennial (2003); XXV São Paulo Biennial (2002) and elsewhere. His grants and residences include the Smithsonian Artist Research Fellowships (2020-23) and the Bellagio Center Creative Arts Fellowship (Rockefeller Foundation) (2012). Apóstol’s work is included in collections such as the Tate Modern; the Guggenheim Museum (New York); the Centre Pompidou; the Centro de Arte Dos de Mayo (CA2M); the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía; the Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo (MUAC); Pérez Art Museum Miami; the Getty Research Institute; the Denver Art Museum and elsewhere.
