Word Power Made Easy was a solo exhibition by Felipe Mujica featuring his ongoing series of curtain installations. The exhibition explored themes of language, translation, and cultural exchange through Mujica's characteristic use of geometric patterns and text.

The title references Norman Lewis's vocabulary-building book, suggesting both the power of language and the difficulty of cross-cultural communication. Mujica's curtains serve as both functional objects and conceptual artworks, creating spaces that are simultaneously private and public, intimate and performative.
