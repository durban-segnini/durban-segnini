**Durban Segnini Gallery is pleased to announce the first solo exhibition of Alessandro Balteo-Yazbeck with the gallery.** This exhibition re-stages and recontextualizes projects conceived in Caracas three decades ago that resonate with our current global situation; tracing the evolution of subjects of material relations, displacement, and systemic interconnection over time.

The exhibition’s title points to a formative period in the artist’s trajectory, when Balteo-Yazbeck began developing strategies to map his own position within a rapidly destabilizing social and political landscape. With his sprawling chalkboard diagrams, rooftop interventions, and large-scale installations—the artist visualized the complex and shifting networks that linked art, politics, and economics in 1990s Venezuela. Balteo-Yazbeck sought not to explicitly narrate but to allude to the invisible webs that shape collective life. Revisiting his early reflections reveals a sustained attention to art’s emotional economies and to traces of meaning that resist commodification and the shifting dynamics of value.
