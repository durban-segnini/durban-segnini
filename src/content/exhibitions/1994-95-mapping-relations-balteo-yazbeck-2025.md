# Opening Saturday November 22, 2025. 6-10pm

#### **Durban Segnini Gallery is pleased to announce the exhibition *1994-95 | Mapping Relations | Balteo-Yazbeck | 2025*, by Venezuelan artist Alessandro Balteo-Yazbeck.**

<br>

*1994–95 | Mapping Relations | Balteo-Yazbeck | 2025* brings together a new body of work that revisits and recontextualizes projects conceived three decades ago in Caracas—works that now resonate with renewed urgency in light of our current global condition. The exhibition unfolds as a dialogue between Balteo-Yazbeck’s early works from the mid-1990s and their contemporary restaging, tracing how questions of relation, displacement, and systemic interconnection have evolved across time.
