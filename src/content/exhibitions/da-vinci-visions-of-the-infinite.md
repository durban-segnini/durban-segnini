**Da Vinci: Visions of the Infinite** presents a curated exploration of Leonardo da Vinci’s lesser-known notebooks, conceptual sketches, and imaginative designs. This fictional exhibition highlights the breadth of his visionary thinking — from celestial diagrams and mechanical inventions to poetic studies of the natural world.

Featuring reconstructed models based on his original sketches, immersive digital interpretations, and newly imagined artworks inspired by his writings, the exhibition invites visitors to step inside the mind of a thinker centuries ahead of his time.
