Mario Abreu's "Eslabon y Esfera" (Link and Sphere) is a sculptural installation that explores the relationship between geometric forms and organic materials. The work combines industrial steel elements with found objects, creating a dialogue between manufactured and natural forms.

The title suggests both connection (eslabon) and wholeness (esfera), reflecting Abreu's interest in the interconnectedness of all things. The sculpture's open structure allows viewers to move around and through it, experiencing different perspectives and relationships between the various elements.
