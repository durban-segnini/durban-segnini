This work from Ana Silva's "Concrete Dreams" series explores the psychological impact of rapid urbanization in Latin American cities. The piece combines concrete fragments, metal scraps, and acrylic paint to create a textured surface that speaks to the layered history of urban development.

The composition suggests both the solidity and fragility of modern urban structures, with cracks and fissures revealing underlying layers of meaning. Silva's use of found materials from construction sites adds an element of authenticity and immediacy to the work, connecting the artistic process to the ongoing transformation of the urban landscape.
