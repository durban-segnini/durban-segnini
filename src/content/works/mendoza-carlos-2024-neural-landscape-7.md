This digital artwork is part of Carlos Mendoza's ongoing investigation into the visual representation of neural networks. Using algorithmic processes inspired by actual brain imaging data, Mendoza creates abstract compositions that mirror the complex patterns of neural connectivity.

The work explores the intersection of consciousness and technology, presenting a visual metaphor for how thoughts and memories might be encoded in the brain's neural pathways. The intricate web-like structures suggest both the beauty and complexity of human cognition, while the digital medium reflects our contemporary relationship with technology and artificial intelligence.
