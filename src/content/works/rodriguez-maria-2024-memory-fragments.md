This work combines traditional embroidery techniques with contemporary photographic processes to explore themes of cultural memory and identity. Rodriguez overlays intricate embroidery patterns onto family photographs, creating a dialogue between personal history and cultural tradition.

The piece examines how memories are constructed, preserved, and transformed across generations, particularly within diasporic communities. The embroidery serves as both a decorative element and a symbolic representation of the labor involved in maintaining cultural connections across time and space.
