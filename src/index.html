      Durban Segnini Gallery is pleased to announce Light for the Amazon, an exhibition
      organized by Omar López-Chahoud with a selection of works from the gallery’s collection.
      With a focus on modern and contemporary art this selection of works highlights some of the
      most important Latin American 20th century masters in conversation with contemporary
      artists from different generations and diverse backgrounds. The works on view range from
      geometric abstraction to loose figuration, reflecting at times on a cross cultural dialogue
      nurtured by references to pre-Hispanic visual languages.
