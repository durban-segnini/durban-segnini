      Durban Segnini Gallery is pleased to announce the exhibition Andrés Arzuaga: One Thousand Days of Light, the
      first major solo exhibition in the United States by Argentine artist Andrés Arzuaga, curated by Carlos
      Gutiérrez. One Thousand Days of Light brings together a new body of work by Andrés Arzuaga that challenges and
      transcends traditional perceptions of time, space, and materiality. Curator Carlos Gutiérrez describes Arzuaga's
      paintings as "enveloped in a pause that dissolves points of departure and arrival, making it impossible to trace
      the paths of that which appears on their surface," creating a captivating interplay of color and form. Each
      piece encapsulates moments that simultaneously emerge and dissolve, carefully balanced on edges that are precise
      yet fluid. Utilizing diverse mediums—oil, resin, and other pigmented materials— Arzuaga vividly embodies complex
      sensory experiences such as early morning plains, the nuanced coloration of resting birds, or the ephemeral
      touch of distant light upon the skin.
