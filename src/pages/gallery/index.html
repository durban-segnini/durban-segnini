      Founded in Caracas in 1970 and based in Miami since 1994, Durban Segnini
      Gallery has played a key role in the international promotion of modern and
      contemporary artists linked to abstraction in Latin&nbsp;America.
    </h3>
    <p>
      For over two decades, it has established itself as a specialized platform
      for non-figurative practices that, through rigorous formal research,
      explore the aesthetic, philosophical, and sensory dimensions of abstract
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a coherent and sustained exhibition program, the gallery has
      contributed to bringing visibility to foundational historical figures of
      Latin American geometric abstraction, articulating a critical narrative
      that engages with international avant-gardes from a historically informed
      and culturally relevant perspective. Exhibitions, publications, and
      institutional collaborations have allowed Durban Segnini to serve as a key
      agent in the dissemination and reappraisal of these artists beyond their
      places of origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, the gallery's curatorial focus seeks to expand that historical
      mission by fostering meaningful connections between different generations
      of abstract artists. Its program proposes a renewed reading of Latin
      American abstraction, in which the geometric tradition is reinterpreted
      and transformed in dialogue with contemporary practices that explore new
      spatial, social, and affective dimensions of non-figurative art.
