            Painter, sculptor, and poet. From an early age, he began painting and participating in political
            demonstrations with friends. In 1935 he met Joaquin Torres Garcia at a conference at the headquarters
            of the Theosophical Society. That year, after creating cubist style proposals, he made his first
            geometric non-orthogonal paintings, transgressing the traditional limits of the rectangle. By 1937, he
            settled in Buenos Aires where he surrounded himself with modern artists and studied philosophy and
            literature. In 1941 he cofounded the bimonthly newspaper <em>El Universitario</em>, where he published his
            political and aesthetic ideas. He participated in the publishing group of <em>Arturo. Revista de Artes
            Abstractas</em> along with Gyula Kosice, Rhod Rothfuss, Edgar Bayley, Tomás Maldonado, and Lidy Prati.
            In 1944 they edited the sole edition, in which Murillo Mendes, Vicente Huidobro, and Torres García also
            collaborated. This publication marked the beginning of the non-figurative movement in Argentina.
