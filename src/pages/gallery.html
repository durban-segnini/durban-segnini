    <h2>
      Founded in Caracas in 1970 and based in Miami since 1994, Durban Segnini Gallery has played a key role in the
      international promotion of modern and contemporary artists linked to abstraction in Latin America.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For over two decades, it has established itself as a specialized platform for non-figurative practices that,
      through rigorous formal research, explore the aesthetic, philosophical, and sensory dimensions of abstract language.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a coherent and sustained exhibition program, the gallery has contributed to bringing visibility to
      foundational historical figures of Latin American geometric abstraction, articulating a critical narrative that
      engages with international avant-gardes from a historically informed and culturally relevant perspective.
      Exhibitions, publications, and institutional collaborations have allowed Durban Segnini to serve as a key agent
      in the dissemination and reappraisal of these artists beyond their places of origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, the gallery's curatorial focus seeks to expand that historical mission by fostering meaningful connections
      between different generations of abstract artists. Its program proposes a renewed reading of Latin American
      abstraction, in which the geometric tradition is reinterpreted and transformed in dialogue with contemporary
      practices that explore new spatial, social, and affective dimensions of non-figurative art.
