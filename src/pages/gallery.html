    <h2>Founded in Caracas in 1970 and based in Miami since 1994, Durban Segnini Gallery has played a key role in the
        international promotion of modern and contemporary artists linked to abstraction in Latin America. For over two
        decades, it has established itself as a specialized platform for non-figurative practices that, through rigorous
        formal research, explore the aesthetic, philosophical, and sensory dimensions of abstract language.</h2>
    <p>With a coherent and sustained exhibition program, the gallery has contributed to bringing visibility to
        foundational historical figures of Latin American geometric abstraction, articulating a critical narrative that
        engages with international avant-gardes from a historically informed and culturally relevant perspective.

        Exhibitions, publications, and institutional collaborations have allowed Durban Segnini to serve as a key agent
        in the dissemination and reappraisal of these artists beyond their places of origin.
        Today, the gallery's curatorial focus seeks to expand that historical mission by fostering meaningful
        connections between different generations of abstract artists.

        Its program proposes a renewed reading of Latin American abstraction, in which the geometric tradition is
        reinterpreted and transformed in dialogue with contemporary practices that explore new spatial, social, and
        affective dimensions of non-figurative art.</p>
