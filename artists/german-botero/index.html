  <h1>Botero, German</h1>

<p>Colombia, 1946</p>


<p>Using materials such as metal, wood, and clay, his structural work is inspired by the machinery and objects of different technologies and cultures. He lives and works in Bogota, Colombia since 1983.</p>
<p>Germán Botero’s body of work is founded upon the traditions of minimalist and land art, where architectural and sculptural forms generate a direct dialog with the landscape. He creates modular structures, that explore the dimensions of space and invite us to think about science in relation to our socio-cultural environment. Working in both small and large scale, his works present an investigation of industrial archeology and allude to ritual sites and ceremonial geographies of pre-Columbian civilizations.</p>
<p>As a specialist in public art, he has installed monumental works in Seoul, Korea, Shanghai, China; in the Mayan region of Chetumal, Mexico; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Montreal, Canada, Resistencia, Argentina and Cuba.</p>
<p>In 2010, during the Olympic games in Beijing, he was presented the Award of Excellence for his work entitled <em>Loto Floreciendo a los Cielos.</em> The exhibition’s theme was China and the World, and the slogan, “The Arts Complement the Spirit of the Olympic Games Celebrated in Beijing.”</p>
<p>Solo shows to note include: “Production Space”, Chamber of Commerce, Medellín, Colombia, 1978; “Regional Space”, Museum of Art National University, Bogota, Colombia, 1982; “Sculptures”. Gallery Workshop Museum of Modern Art La Tertulia, Cali, Colombia, 1992; “Metal”. Buckingham Shire County Museum at Milton Keynes -Buckingham Shire County Museum, Aylesbury, UK, 1994; “Geometer &amp; Archaeologist”. Durban Segnini Gallery, Miami, 2016.
