    <h2>Durban Segnini Gallery was founded in 1970 in Caracas, Venezuela and has been based in Miami since 1994. For
        nearly 6 decades it has promoted Latin American art and culture with an emphasis on geometric abstraction.
        Through its tailored programming, participation in international art fairs, and its long-standing
        relationships with museums, collectors and curators it advocates the work of avant-garde artists past,
        present, and future that continue to shape the global art community.</h2>
    <p>Durban Segnini Gallery is internationally recognized as an alma mater gallery in its
        work with contemporary Latin American art. A work that has specialized in
        Abstraction in its most diverse expressions, from Geometric Abstraction through
        Kinetic Art and Optical Art to Abstract Expressionism. During its more than four
        decades, Durban Segnini has promoted and publicized great masters, exhibited by
        the gallery at the most important contemporary art fairs in Europe, the United States
        and Latin America. Its professionalism and specialization is internationally
        prestigious for a work developed in three stages. The first one was its foundation in
        Venezuela (Caracas, 1970), the second its opening in Spain (Madrid, 1975) and the
        current stage, when Durban Segnini opened its doors in the United States (Miami,
        1992).
        In the first stage, the gallery exhibited members of the Taller Libre de Arte (Free Art
        Workshop) such as, among others, Omar Carreño, Carlos Cruz Diez and Oswaldo
        Vigas, who were renewing the Venezuelan and Latin American visual arts panorama
        of the moment. On the other hand, Durban Segnini made presentations of books,
        organized concerts, produced editions of graphic art, printed catalogs and created
        literary gatherings. The second stage in Madrid incorporated Informalist Abstract
        painters such as Antonio Saura, Modest Cuixart or Antoní Tápies, vital figures to
        understand Spanish postwar art. Founder gallery of the ARCO Madrid art fair. To this
        trajectory is added the current stage in the United States (founder gallery of Art
        Miami fair), where it has produced more than one hundred exhibitions. Among them
        are the great masters of Latin American Abstraction, among others, Carmelo Arden
        Quín, Mateo Manaure, Fernando de Szyszlo, Juvenal Ravelo and Manuel Felguérez.
        Editing English-Spanish catalogs with extensive graphic documentation and essays
        written by critics and specialized curators, among them Literature Nobel Prize Mario
        Vargas Llosa. Durban Segnini is the first Latin American gallery to design an
        exhibition program specifically focused on Latin American sculpture, with
        participating sculptors such as Gonzalo Fonseca, Agustín Cárdenas, Eduardo
        Ramirez Villamizar Pablo Atchugarry and Victor Varela.

        Durban Segnini revitalizes the presence of the teachers of the Colombian Geometric
        Abstraction, less known than their Latin American counterparts, such as Omar Rayo,
        Manolo Vellojin, Eduardo Ramírez Villamizar, Carlos Rojas or Germán Botero.
        Parallel to this, Durban Segnini has produced exhibition projects curated by
        recognized critics and international curators dedicated to the study of Abstract Art in
        Latin America. The gallery has donated works to important museums like the
        Contemporary Art Museum Sofia Ímber and the Museum of Fine Arts of Houston. It
        also organizes conferences, catalog presentations, books, and conversations
        involving directors of prestigious museums and Abstract Art collections, along with
        professors from renowned American universities. This multifaceted vocation has

        turned Durban Segnini a rigorous international epicenter in the exhibition of Latin
        American Abstract Art; also an influential forum with novel readings on Abstraction,
        relating in his visions great masters with new and promising figures who are
        renewing today the Latin American Abstraction panorama of the XXI century.</p>
